    "1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.\n",
    "* \n",
    "'hello'\n",
    "-87.8\n",
    "- \n",
    "/ \n",
    "    • \n",
    "6 \n",
    "     \n",
    "     Solution-->  (‘hello’, -87.8, 6) are values and (-, /, +) are expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is the difference between string and variable?\n",
    "       \n",
    "       Solution--> String is the type of data like what type of data we stored for example if our data type is string that means that data only contain a characters.\n",
    "      Variable is store where we store our data in a specific data type like integer type, float type even a string type etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Describe three different data types.\n",
    "      \n",
    "        Solution--> Integer-- This data type only contain a numeric values without any decimal point implementation in python, a=int().\n",
    "Float-- This data type only contain a real values with a decimal point implementation in python, a=float().\n",
    "String-- This data type only contains a caracters In other words String is a array of character,implementation in python, a=str().\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?\n",
    "\n",
    "       Solution--> An expression is a combination of  operators and operands that is interpreted to produce some other value. An expression is evaluated as per the precedence of its operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?\n",
    "\n",
    "        Solution--> As i said in previous solution  An expression is a combination of  operators and operands that is interpreted to produce or return some other value on the other hand the statements, like spam = 10 only assign the value to the variable it does not return anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?\n",
    "bacon = 22\n",
    "bacon + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "      Solution-->  The variable bacon contain 22\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What should the values of the following two terms be?\n",
    " \n",
    "       'spam' + 'spamspam'--> 'spamspamspam'\n",
    "       'spam' * 3  --> 'spamspamspam'\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?\n",
    "\n",
    "        Solution--> 100 is not a valid variable name because variable name con not be start from a numerig value and special character except a underscore _, for example _100 and e100 is also a valid variable name. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value?\n",
    "\n",
    "        Solution--> int()-- for Interger number\n",
    "       float()-- for floating-point number\n",
    "       str()—for string\n",

    "\n",

    "10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?\n",
    "'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'\n",
    "\n",
    "    Solution-->  This expression cause an error because in this expression we try to do the addition between the string values and integer value this is not possible to do the addition between interger and string if we want to fix this expression then we convert the 99 in to a string or remove the 99 from expression.\n",
    "For example -- 'I have eaten '  + ' burritos.'=  ’I have eaten burritos.’\n",
    "'I have eaten ' + ‘99’ + ' burritos.'= I have eaten 99 burritos.\n",
